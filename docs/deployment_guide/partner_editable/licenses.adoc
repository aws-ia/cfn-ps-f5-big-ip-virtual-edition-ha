The Partner Solution requires a subscription to the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for {partner-product-name}, which is available from https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace^].

By default, this Partner Solution deploys https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-nlakutvltzij4[F5 BIG-IP BEST with IPI and Threat Campaigns (PAYG, 25Mbps)^] instances.

If you want to deploy other types of {partner-product-short-name} instances, accept the terms for the desired offering and obtain the AMI ID for that offering. For example, to get the list of {partner-product-short-name} AMI IDs in us-east-1, pass the desired AMI ID to the template's *bigIpImageId* parameter.

[source,yaml]
----
aws ec2 describe-images --filters 'Name=name,Values=*BIGIP*' --query 'Images[*].[ImageId,Name]' --region us-east-1

If deploying to a production environment, you can use Bring Your Own License (BYOL) instances (for example, https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-73utu5c5sfyyc[F5 BIG-IP VE - ALL (BYOL, 2 Boot Locations)^]), which require registration keys. If you don't have registration keys, visit the https://www.f5.com/trials/big-ip-virtual-edition[F5 website^]. Additional pricing, terms, and conditions may apply.
