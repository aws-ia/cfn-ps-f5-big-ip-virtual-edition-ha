AWS Cloud.

Figure 1: Partner Solution architecture for {partner-product-short-name} on AWS

As shown in Figure 1, the Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A VPC configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*

* In the public subnets:

** Managed NAT gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
** A Linux bastion host in an Auto Scaling group to allow inbound Secure
Shell (SSH) access to EC2 instances in public and private subnets.*
** BIG-IP VE deployed to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

* In the private subnets:
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Make sure that the additional components are also represented in the architecture diagram.

** An example application to help demonstrate {partner-product-short-name} functionality.
** An elastic network interface that represents the public-facing network interface card (NIC) of a clustered pair of BIG-IP VE instances.

* AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) for a role and EC2 instance profile.
* An Amazon S3 SSE-S3 encrypted bucket used to provide failover state.

*The template that deploys the Partner Solution into an existing VPC skips
the components marked by asterisks and prompts you for your existing VPC
configuration.
